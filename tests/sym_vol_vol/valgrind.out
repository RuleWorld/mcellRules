Defining molecules with the following theoretical average diffusion distances:
  l_r_bar=22.5675833 um for volume_proxy
  l_r_bar=17.7245385 um for surface_proxy


Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 3.6790e-13 set for volume_proxy{0} + volume_proxy{0} -> volume_proxy{0} volume_proxy{0} 

Reaction probabilities generated for the following reactions:
	Probability 1.0000e-06 set for volume_proxy{0} -> volume_proxy{0} 

Surfaces with surface class "reflect{1}" are REFLECTIVE for volume molecules  volume_proxy{0}.
Borders of regions with surface class "reflect{1}" are REFLECTIVE for surface molecules  surface_proxy{0}.

Exiting run loop.

Warning: Some molecules had a lifetime short relative to the timestep.
  Mean lifetime of volume_proxy was 4.13971 timesteps.

Warning: During the simulation some reaction probabilities were greater than 1.You may want to rerun the simulation with the WARNINGS block enabled to get more detail.
